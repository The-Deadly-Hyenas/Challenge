# Challenge
UE Machine Learning and Pattern Classification Classification Challenge

The dataset for the challenge consists of one file that includes the (low- and mid-level) features without targets or high-level features (the GEMS and GEMMES features). 
In these files, each row corresponds to the features for an audio snippet (identified by a unique combination of pianist_id, segment_id and snippet_id).
The following files are provided: (python) as a pickled pandas DataFrame (python) as a pickled numpy ndarray (WEKA) as an ARFF file (Matlab) as a MatLab struct (generic) as a CSV file

For training your models, please use the same training dataset as in task 3.

You want to maximise FilMOTION’s gain!

New Task Formulation (Until June 22nd)

■ Classify known emotions: happy, angry, sad, relaxed

■ Different input: use only audio features

■ New performance measure: instead of highest accuracy,highest gain (according to matrix)

■ Consider slightly different data distribution!



Evaluation

■ You only get test features, no targets

■ Test-set predictions are uploaded to server

■ Formatting is described on server

■ Upload 3 times a week max. (under Filmotion!)

■ Best submission will be final rank!

■ No “questions”: Report all findings in a slide deck!
